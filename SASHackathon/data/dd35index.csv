"At Arizona Public Service (APS).% meters are exchanged in the field when they are at or nearing its end-of-life cycle based on recurring processes that we have in place today. The first recurring process manually looks for meters that are non-communicating for at least 10 consecutive days. The second recurring process automatically creates a meter exchange order when a certain meter event is sent to our Meter Data Management System (MDMS). There are 23 events currently configured to create an auto exchange order. The last process is creating ad-hoc meter exchange orders for any meters not caught in one of the aforementioned processes but found through some other method of review. There are gaps with each of these processes that can lead to meters being missed entirely or not exchanged in a timely manner. The result of these gaps will cause meters to estimate longer than necessary and potentially lead to a billing impact and a negative customer experience. APS wants to harness the power of AI to move towards becoming more proactive.% less reactive.% in exchanging meters prior to the end of its life cycle to reduce the number of daily estimations within our MDMS as well as estimated bills to improve the customer experience and trust in APS."

To combat this.  we will produce a solution which assesses the trustworthiness of open source data.  using NLP and classification models to determine whether a source contains misinformation or has potentialially been tampered with.  The main UI will be an LLM chat bot.  which will explain the reasoning behind its recommendation.   A link to a summary dashboard will be provided.  which will show the user's previous queries and their outcomes.  so they can keep a list of acceptable data sources for future use. It will also show geographical trends in the data.  e.g. ranking countries by their data credibility.  (more info)"
"Reducing carbon emissions is a top priority for companies. In many countries.  this is already enforced by company strategies and legislations. With the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and CO2 performance ladder.  companies are committed to realize reductions year on year. Not realizing a reduction can result in decertification or reputational damages. Emissions that are related to commuting are often significant and could amount as much as 60  of a company’s total emissions. Even though the utilization of offices has decreased significantly due to hybrid work environments.  employees still maintain some level of commuting for various reasons.     Companies aiming to reduce their CO2 emissions across the board are struggling with questions like..  • How can a reduction in carbon emissions related to commuting be realized?  • What reduction can be gained with different transportation modes and vehicle choices?

"The goal is to predict acres damaged on insured agricultural land due to hail. For an insurance company.  if a client has insured a land which has hail coverage (either straight hail or hail endorsement) for crops/land.  the company wants to be proactive. The insurance company wants its clients to first know the likelihood of hail in their township (township.  range.  meridian). In that case.  the insurance company wants the client to know how many acres might be affected. This sets the stage for knowing how much claim a client can get.     So.  the insurance company will have an idea how many acres may be damaged due to the hail in the townships and clients will also have an idea how many acres of crop may be affected in the township.    The team will use SAS to prepare and analyze the data to get it ready for modelling. We will further use the open-source capabilities of SAS-Viya to model the data to reach our end goal of building a predictive model.  ;"
